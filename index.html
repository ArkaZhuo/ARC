        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) evaluates a system’s ability to infer novel grid transformation
          rules from only a few examples. Despite strong performance on many NLP benchmarks, large language models
          (LLMs) still struggle with ARC’s discrete, compositional reasoning. In this work, we present a systematic
          study of prompt engineering strategies for ARC. We design five base prompting strategies targeting different
          failure modes: Minimal Prompting, Reasoned Prompting, Schema-Constrained Prompting, Reflective Prompting,
          and Structured Few-shot Prompting. Building upon these strategies, we propose an Adaptive Selection method
          that dynamically chooses the most suitable strategy based on task characteristics, combined with multi-agent
          collaboration for iterative refinement. Experiments on val.jsonl show that our method achieves 66.7% accuracy,
          outperforming all base strategies. On the more challenging val hard.jsonl, our method achieves approximately
          four-fold improvement over the baseline. Through error analysis and case studies, we identify that rule error
          is the dominant failure mode and reveal the complementary strengths of different prompting strategies for
          abstract reasoning tasks.
        </p>

        <h2>Prompting Strategies</h2>
        <p>
          We design five base prompting strategies targeting distinct failure modes in ARC reasoning:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Minimal Prompting</li>
          <li>Reasoned Prompting</li>
          <li>Schema-Constrained Prompting</li>
          <li>Reflective Prompting</li>
          <li>Structured Few-shot Prompting</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Adaptive Selection + Multi-Agent Refinement</h2>
        <p>
          Building on the base strategies, we introduce an Adaptive Selection method that chooses the most suitable
          prompting strategy for each task based on its characteristics. We also incorporate multi-agent collaboration
          to iteratively refine predictions and mitigate rule errors.
        </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>66.7% accuracy on val.jsonl, outperforming all base strategies.</li>
          <li>Approximately four-fold improvement on val hard.jsonl.</li>
          <li>Error analysis shows rule error as the dominant failure mode and reveals complementary strengths of the strategies.</li>
        </ul>
